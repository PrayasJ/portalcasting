# working on the fill functions
# on fill_data


users adding models should permanently add code to model_script_controls()
rather than write their own functions






# we also might want to create a simple repo for testing!
# basically, like the PD and PP, but just for tests


# later capacity: 
#  1. make it so download version numbers are retained to allow checking to
#  prevent unneeded downloads
#  2. github
# 

# important notes for news
#  directory tree structure simplified
#   dirtree is no more, even tho the structure is still there
#   base is no more, if you want to make that structure use main = "./name"
#  download capacity generalized
#   any zenodo record or concept; any ready-to-go url; (will add any github)
#  PortalData has been removed as a sub and replaced with "raw", which 
#   includes all unzipped raw downloads (portal data and portal predictions)
#  users adding models should permanently add code to model_script_controls()
#   rather than write their own control functions
