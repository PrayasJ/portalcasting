right now: working to update the model generation.
as of now, the .R files are generated, but they're not right (out of date)


# consider (i.e. do) organizing the documentation for the options lists so 
# they're all together





#
# need to update the function flexibibility, to flexibly write model scripts
# leverage the tree set up to basically just pass the tree to the
# read and write functions (wrap them if needed)
# it'll likely be easier if we just give all the model functions covariates
#  but we could also make some indicator for them
