\description{
Currently, the historical covariate data forecasts are being
  held in the \code{extdata} folder in the package directory, and are the
  transfer is hard-wired to come from there. In the future, we should 
  consider housing the data differently (they'll be continuously updated
  with the forecasts), and thus we'll want to un-hard-wire that.
