working:

the models are now simply written as functions within scripts, which is ideal

but need to update the models themselves t reflect how the function will be used
very very streamlined to a single data stream



the data sets are nicely organized and generated now
can pop back to the models

starting with a single simple model

what should the AutoArima function accomplish?
