The *portalcasting* package provides the ability to add functions both to a local copy of the repository for testing as well as to contribute to the base set of models provided within the package (and thus executed in the
main repository). Similarly, users may often want or need to analyze the data in a slightly different configuration than what is already available. Here, we walk through the steps to add user-defined models and data sets to the directory for local use or for integration within the production pipeline.

For the purposes here, consider that you are interested in adding a model named "newmod" to the forecasting suite. While "newmod" can work on the existing data, you are are really interested in a slightly different configuration (perhaps only the long-term kangaroo rat exclosures) of the data you call "newdata".  


## Adding a model

add the controls to the \code{prefab_model_controls} non-exported function
in the \code{prepare_models.R} script
will automatically add the model to the prefab_models 

## Adding a data set

sames for data sets
